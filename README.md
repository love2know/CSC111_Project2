Road transportation plays a prominent role in the present-day transportation system. Freight transported by trucks accounts for 62\% of the total tonnage of freight movement in the US in 2020 [1], and motor vehicles traveled 3.17 trillion vehicle miles on US roads in 2022 [2]. Due to the dominant role of road transportation, it arises as a significant objective for motor vehicle users to determine an optimal route to travel from a given origin to a given destination via a system of roads that minimizes travel costs, such as distance or time. A variety of algorithms for planning routes in a network of roads have been proposed and applied.
